than&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; space&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-breaking&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; space.<br />

<h3>"Less Than" and "Greater Than" Example</h3>
<p>
Although the less than (<) and the greater than (>) symbol don't need character entity code
for your browser to display them separately. You'll face problems if you want to place them together.
The browser may mistaken it as a tag and try to convert it.<br />
e.g. You won't be able to show &lt;h1&gt; in your browser without the help of those entity codes. <br />
Try it and see for yourself.
